              <h2>Inspiration</h2>

              <p> We started off thinking about user needs and potential contexts in which shadowboxing might fulfill these needs. Initially, we began with the idea of merely having it as an interactive art installation, much like the ones we watched in class from Scott Snibbe. In a more functional vein, we thought it could also be a form of entertainment for people waiting in long lines, such as at the post office or the bookstore. Combining art with function, we realized it could also be a way to help people appreciate different parts of campus, to encourage people to think creatively, or even as just a tourist attraction for the swarms of people that visit Stanford daily. 

              Drawing from our brainstorm for contexts of use, we thought through different locations the shadowboxing could take place, as well as different surfaces on which they could be displayed. From the typical white wall, we branched out to more unique surfaces on which to display the shadows both indoors and out for more interesting textures and effects. We considered displaying our installation on the grass, on bodies of water, on sidewalks, on stairs, on curtains, among others. </p>

              <iframe class="iframe" src="http://www.stanford.edu/~fguzman1/cgi-bin/CS247/abc.html"></iframe>

              Below are the descriptions of some of the ideas we contemplated:
              <ul>
                  <li> <b> cut shadows </b>: Users’ shadows will be displayed normally at first, but through gesture interactions, can be cut in half so that the bottom half of the shadow is completely separate from the top half  </li>
                  <li> <b> color mixing </b>: Users’ shadows will be displayed in primary colors, so the overlapping of shadows will result in the mixing of those colors on that part </li>
                  <li> <b> green-screen </b>: Users’ shadows will be displayed on any of a number of different backgrounds (e.g. under the sea, in the mountains, in space, etc.) </li>
                  <li> <b> magic 8 ball </b>: Users can ask the “magic 8 ball” a question, which will then display an arrow over the person representing the answer. E.g. “who is the fairest of them all?”</li>
                  <li> <b> object bouncing </b>: User shadows will be delineated by objects bouncing off the contours of their shadows  </li>
                  <li> <b> complete the story </b>: All users’ shadows are captured and displayed like a snapshot shadow for a set period of time in order to “complete a story” on the wall, winding up with a scene made up of various shadows that will eventually disappear for the next round of users to use </li>
                  <li> <b> tetris </b>: A shadow version of human tetris seen on popular Japanese game shows. “Shadow walls” approach users with cutouts that users have to make sure to fit their shadows into. </li>
                  <li> <b> hands of a clock </b>: The shadow of the user’s arms and body is used as the hands of a clock. Moving of the “hands” will result in a changing display of the time of day on the display </li>
                  <li> <b> mirror shadow </b>: Users’ shadow displayed normally </li>
                  <li> <b> spirit animals </b>: Instead of displaying users’ shadows, we display shadows of animals, their “spirit” animals  </li>
                  <li> <b> warhol pop art </b>: Each user’s shadow is displayed four times in four different quadrants, using pop art colors to evoke the style of Warhol </li>
                  <li> <b> warhol pop art </b>: Each user’s shadow is displayed four times in four different quadrants, using pop art colors to evoke the style of Warhol </li>
                  <li> <b> painting with shadows </b>: Users’ movements are captured as gestural shadows. For example, a swiping of the arm would display a large shadow stroke in the same direction the arm moved, rather than showing a shadow of the person </li>
                  <li> <b> personalized weather </b>: Each user’s shadow is displayed along with a shadow of his or her personalized weather. For instance, one user may have a shadow with a rain cloud above the head, while another may have one with a sun </li>
                  <li> <b> imaginary food </b>: Users’ shadows are displayed holding various imaginary foods </li>
                  <li> <b> mermaid </b>: Users’ shadows are displayed with shadows of mermaid tails where their feet should be  </li>
                  <li> <b> dragonball-z </b>: Users can move their shadows into fighting poses and shoot fireballs at each other similar to the fight scenes in the anime, Dragon Ball Z. </li>
                  <li> <b> opposite shadow </b>: Users are in two different rooms, but each see only the shadow of the other person displayed on the wall, and never their own </li>
              </ul>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p> Ultimately, we decided to go with our Warhol idea, and place it in the Stanford Design School to encourage people from all over to visit the d.school and express themselves creatively in such a creative environment. However, to increase interaction and make the shadowboxing more engaging, we decided to allow users to capture a photo of their Warhol shadow and send a postcard to anyone they chose, both allowing them to commemorate their visit and inviting other people to visit the installation as well.

        <h2>Sketching</h2>
        <p> Armed with various user needs and contexts of use, we then began thinking through different ways to manipulate shadows and create meaningful interactions for our users. From our vast list of shadowboxing ideas, we whittled our choices down to three ideas to create detailed sketches of: Warhol, opposite shadow, and complete the story. These were the three ideas that interested us the most, so we began considering the different trade-offs for each idea, as well as their links to the goals we wanted to reach. </p>

        <p> We liked that our Warhol idea could be used as an art installation, a tourist attraction and encourage people to think creatively using the style of one of history’s most influential artists, but we knew that simply displaying the shadows in the four quadrants did not create enough of an interaction between our users and their shadows. For our opposite shadows idea, we liked the idea of encouraging social behavior, but realized there would always have to be at least two people in order for it to create interesting interactions, and the users would be relatively isolated in each room. Finally, for complete the story, although we liked the idea of preserving past shadows and allowing people to collaborate on creating a scene of shadows, we realized that the display could get extremely crowded by noise and wind up looking like a mess more than anything. </p>
